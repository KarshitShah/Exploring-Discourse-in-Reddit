# Exploring Discourse in Reddit

This project is based on text classification. It classifies posts into one of the subreddits from the text of the post. The problem acquires posts from three different subreddits. The data is balanced as 600 posts are acquired from each thread. The subreddits we chose for this project are:

  1) r/cricket
  2) r/nba
  3) r/science
